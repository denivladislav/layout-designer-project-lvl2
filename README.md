This layout was created in order to improve my OOCSS design skills (desktop first).

Main page contains information about «Music Box» app. Artist page contains information about a certain artist, popular tracks and similar artists. You may navigate between these pages via navigation bar.

This layout is also adapted for mobile devices.
